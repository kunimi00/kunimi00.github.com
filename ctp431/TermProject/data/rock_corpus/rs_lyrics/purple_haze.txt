Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Yeah!

Purple haze all in my eyes,
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blow, blowin' my mind, is it..
Tomorrow, or just the end of time?
