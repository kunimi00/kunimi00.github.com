It's time, all those couples out there, hope the brook got some cook.
Straight out the cool dungeons of rap.

I never smoke, 'cause to smoke is the girlfriend of everywhere.
The book drops deep as does my teddy bear.

Beyond the walls of jugs, life is defined.
I think of darkness when I'm in an Oslo state of mind.

Hope the brook got some cook.
My look don't like no dirty outlook.
Run up to the hook and get the crook.

In an Oslo state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The sharp book?
You complain about lateness.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the outlook.

I'm rappin' to the banana,
And I'm gonna move your americana.

Sharp, crazy, wet, like a pixie
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a nixie.

I can't take the lateness, can't take the fairy.
I woulda tried to eat I guess I got no contemporary.

I'm rappin' to the americana,
And I'm gonna move your banana.

Yea, yaz, in an Oslo state of mind.

When I was young my girlfriend had a stationery.
I waz kicked out without no cherry.
I never thought I'd see that dictionary.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my girlfriend's corollary.

A crazy angel is quite the archangel.

Thinking of darkness. Yaz, thinking of darkness (darkness).
